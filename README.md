# Project3CSCE
Project 3 for Class
Due December 3rd
## This is the log for the work done

**November 18th 1:13 AM:**
Started Project, but just did basic Github testing to understand things! I will probably fully  
start the project during ThanksGiving Break!  
  
**November 18th 1:41 AM:**
Added enum for the menu and also created the student struct  
  
**November 18th 9:32 AM:**
Added all the functions(Functions aren't completed just the mainframe is added),  
and started slowly building the interface!  
  
**November 19th 9:02 PM:**
Added Rap0249.h, student.dat, and getNumber.cpp! I feel like the getNumber.cpp function isn't doing what it's suppose to but I  
think i need to recode it and fix it with pointers in order for it to return the correct count
